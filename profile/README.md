### Contents
The IMARPE Repository includes the following types of content:

#### Pelagic resources
##### North-Center Anchoveta Stock (**ancNC**)
- Evaluation of the north-center anchoveta stock in Peru. [Here]()

##### South Anchoveta Stock (**ancS**)
- Evaluation of the available anchoveta stock in the southern region of the Peruvian sea.

##### Peruvian Jack Mackerel Stock (**jjm**)
- Evaluation of the Peruvian jack mackerel stock.


##### R Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in R for marine and fisheries data analysis. These packages are designed to assist researchers and policymakers in analyzing large datasets, modeling marine populations, and performing statistical analysis of marine resources.

##### Python Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in Python for modeling and analysis of marine data. These packages provide functions for data visualization, statistical modeling, and simulations related to marine ecology.

##### C++ Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in C++ for optimization and simulation in marine ecology. These are high-performance tools used in computational biology, population dynamics modeling, and ecosystem simulations.
