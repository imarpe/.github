***IMARPE Repository*** provides open access to the scientific and technical outputs of the ***Instituto del Mar del Perú (IMARPE)***. This repository hosts research reports, datasets, software tools, publications, projects, packages, and processes developed by its researchers. Its goal is to promote **reproducibility, replicability**, and the sharing of knowledge. Additionally, the repository is designed as an open platform that is accessible to researchers.

### Contents
The IMARPE Repository includes the following types of content:

### Pelagic resources
#### North-Center Anchoveta Stock (ancnc)
- Evaluation of the north-central Peruvian anchoveta (_Engraulis ringens_) stock based on survey data.[Here](https://github.com/imarpe/anchNC_survey_based_assessment)
- Evaluation of the north-central Peruvian anchoveta (_Engraulis ringens_) stock using the SPiCT model. [Here](https://github.com/imarpe/anchNC_survey_based_assessment)

##### South Anchoveta Stock (**ancsr**)
- Evaluation of the available anchoveta stock in the southern region of the Peruvian sea.

##### Peruvian Jack Mackerel Stock (**jjm**)
- Evaluation of the Peruvian jack mackerel stock.


##### R Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in R for marine and fisheries data analysis. These packages are designed to assist researchers and policymakers in analyzing large datasets, modeling marine populations, and performing statistical analysis of marine resources.

##### Python Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in Python for modeling and analysis of marine data. These packages provide functions for data visualization, statistical modeling, and simulations related to marine ecology.

##### C++ Packages Developed
- Tools and libraries developed in C++ for optimization and simulation in marine ecology. These are high-performance tools used in computational biology, population dynamics modeling, and ecosystem simulations.
